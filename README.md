# Role based authentication

Authentication service made for ExpressJS and MongoDB using JWT. We tried to make it as clean and structured as possible. We also provide this documentation on how to install and integrate it with your own application.

> The code uses MongoDB, in case you are using another database there are few changes that has to be made to the configuration and the routes.

> > **It is also not final and always open for reviews and enhancements, especially when it comes to security**
